##Known issues

- Filter button does nothing (It was not enough info in the test task, was it should do)
- Missing Android design. (As Android design was missing, I desided to make similar design for both platforms)
- Creation date is missing for videos (I think I didn't find a way where to get this creation date, there is only creation date for user in response)
  

Hope you like it and looking forward to your feedback
